# Description
This repository aim to implement a [CrowdSec](https://doc.crowdsec.net/) bouncer for the routers of [Unifi](https://www.ui.com/) to block malicious IP to access your services.
For this it leverages [Unifi API](https://ubntwiki.com/products/software/unifi-controller/api) to populate a dynamic Firewall Address List. Specically the Go Library [go-unifi](https://github.com/filipowm/go-unifi) is used.

# Acknowledgment
This is a Fork of [funkolab/cs-mikrotik-bouncer](https://github.com/funkolab/cs-mikrotik-bouncer) and would not have been possible without this previous work

# Usage
For now, this web service is mainly thought to be used as a container.   
If you need to build from source, you can get some inspiration from the Dockerfile.


## Prerequisites
You should have a Unifi appliance and a CrowdSec instance running.   
The container is available as docker image `ghcr.io/teifun2/cs-unifi-bouncer`. It must have access to CrowdSec and to Unifi.   

Generate a bouncer API key following [CrowdSec documentation](https://doc.crowdsec.net/docs/cscli/cscli_bouncers_add)

## Procedure
1. Get a bouncer API key from your CrowdSec with command `cscli bouncers add unifi-bouncer`
2. Copy the API key printed. You **_WON'T_** be able the get it again.
3. Paste this API key as the value for bouncer environment variable `CROWDSEC_BOUNCER_API_KEY`, instead of "MyApiKey"
4. Start bouncer with `docker-compose up bouncer` in the `example` directory
5. It will directly communicate with your Unifi appliance and configure Rules and IP Groups


## Configuration
The bouncer configuration is made via environment variables:
